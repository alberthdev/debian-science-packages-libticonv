Comment:
 The exception provided in the README of this package is invalid.
 The exception is only for the libticables source package, not the
 libticonv package. Furthermore, upsteam has stated that the exception has
 expired due to the new licensing status of the packages depending on the
 libti* libraries. Emails documenting the situation follow.

 All true, and if you want to drop that exception in future versions
 you'll have no objections from me.
 .
 This exception only ever applied to libticables2; if it's mentioned in
 the other libraries' README files I'm sure that was a mistake.

 Well, said exception was created years before my time as the maintainer...
 I _think_ that this exception is obsolete nowadays, as TilEm 2.0 is
 completely free software. TilEm 0.x used a component with a non-free
 license, but it has been replaced with free software for the TilEm 2.0
 release, produced this year, which Albert is attempting to package for
 Debian as well.
